title: Setting up my account on github
---


<div class="message">
  These steps have been necessary to setup my github account.
</div>

Motivation
=============

With my github account <a href="#">wm65</a> it is possible to host repositories, 
have a personal homepage, have an issue managementsystem, a blog and *that all for free!*

> One aspect of special interest for me is the possibility to work on artefacts together with other people
never **loosing the history** or overwriting contents by accident. 


Steps
==============
* first I got an github account: **wm65**
* You should not forget to verify your email, otherwise some services (like GitHub Pages) are not working.
* then I made my first repository: **wm65.github.io** 
    Why this name? Well for your normal work you go to your github-dashboard **github.org/wm65** and you get an overview of your repositories, issues and so on.
    But if you want a user-friendly, homepage-like appearance that's not the right place. Therefore you have the opportunity to create your own *github-homepage*, so called [GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/what-are-github-pages).
    The only rule you have to obey is having an repository named like ```<your-github-name>.github.io``` with a branch called master.

There you can put your ```html-```, ```css-``` and ```js```-files for your homepage. They even have an [Automatic Page Generator](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-pages-with-the-automatic-generator), which you can use.

But there's more: Static page generation with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). 
* setup Jekyll-templates, but that's a topic for tomorrow ...
