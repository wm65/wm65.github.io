Static page generation with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). 

* setup Jekyll-templates: here I followed the instructions at http://in-the-attic.com/2013/01/04/building-a-blog-using-jekyll-bootstrap-and-github-pages-a-beginners-guide/

* now I am ready with setup and can start writing my pages: don't forget the naming convention: ```year-month-day-<topic>.md``` and put it in the ```_posts```-folder.

> for writing markdown and yaml-files in eclipse I installed these plugins:
 * Markdown Text Editor
 * YEdit
